/*  Note to self: Read all the problems more closely; some implementations might
    not be the way I would do it, but I still need to read closely.

    If I had more time to do this I would probably /actually/ trace the
    programs, but I choose not to, because I know I can and it takes long enough
    that I would rather not waste my time and should just guess on things like
    number of iterations or output of recursive/iterative functions.
