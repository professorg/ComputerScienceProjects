Exercise 6.2
p. 207 #1,3,4
p. 212-213 #1,2,3

p. 207

1.  Formal parameters are the expected parameters that define the method, and
    actual parameters are the parameters passed when calling the method.

3.  public int sum(int a, int b) { a+b }

4.  Local variables are used when the variable needs to be used only once or a
    few times inside a code block.

p. 212-213

1.  An instance variable has the same lifetime as the object it is attached to,
    a local variable is only for a single code block, and a
    parameter is used until the method call returns or ends.

2.  Two variables with the same name reference different objects or primitives.
    If you mean to reference one instead of the other, for example in a
    constructor, it could be bad:
        
        int myNumber;
        
        public MyObject(int myNumber) {
            myNumber = myNumber;
        }

3.  a.
        instance vars: a,b
        parameters: x,y
        local variables: c,d
    b.
        instance: used anywhere in the class.
        parameters, locals: only used in the Mutator.

    c.
        instance: destroyed with the Object
        parameters and locals: destroyed/dereferenced when method ends
